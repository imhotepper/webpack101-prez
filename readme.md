This is the starting point for the [webpack101](https://slides.com/imhotepp/webpack101/live) prezentation.

In order to make the conversion from plain html to webpack configured, swithch to webpack-start branch:

```
git checkout webpack-start
```

and follow the steps in the readme of that branch.

The final version of the webpack transformation is visible inside the branch webpack-end

```
git checkout webpack-end
```

Happy coding,
