# From HTML to Webpack 4 : starter blog website

This is the development configuration ready for the [webpack101](https://slides.com/imhotepp/webpack101/live) prezentation.


To run this version of the webpack transformation use the following commands once you have node 10+ available:

1. Install dependencies
```cmd
yarn
```
2. start the dev server:

```cmd
yarn dev
```



It should start the webside with the files bundled through webpack but not ready for Production.



Happy coding,
